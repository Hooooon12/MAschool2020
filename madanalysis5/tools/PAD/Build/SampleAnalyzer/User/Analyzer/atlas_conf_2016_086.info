this XML file serves for the statistical interpretation of the MA5 simulation. 
it lists the number of observed events <nobs>, number of expected backgrounds <nb> 
and number of background uncertainty <deltanb> in each of the regions

     region definition: the attribute "id" has to match the name of the region
     as defined in the analysis code;
     the attribute "type" can be "signal" or "control" and is optional (default=signal)
     when results are given after combination of several signal regions
     (as is the case here: SF instead of ee and mumu separately)
     the signal regions should be given in the attribute "id" separated by
     semicolons
